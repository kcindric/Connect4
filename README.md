# Connect4

A glorified version of tic-tac-toe as a C# console app


To do list:
- make a more elegant IsWinner check
- add a restriction so a user can't add X or O verticaly if the column is full
- feature that allows only integer input to avoid errors if the input is a string
- a possibility to play more than one round
- score board
